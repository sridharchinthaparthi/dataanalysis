        "# Student Performance Analysis System  \n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Overview  \n",
        "In schools and colleges, evaluating student performance is often time-consuming and repetitive. Teachers need to record marks, calculate totals, find averages, check pass/fail status, and analyze class performance. This project aims to **automate the student marks management system** using **Python and NumPy**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The system is designed as a **menu-driven application** where users can input student marks, perform analytics, and generate insights instantly. It helps to **reduce manual effort** and ensures **accuracy** in student evaluations.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives  \n",
        "- Automate the process of storing and analyzing student marks.  \n",
        "- Provide **student-wise and subject-wise performance reports**.  \n",
        "- Enable **quick re-evaluation** by updating marks.  \n",
        "- Display **pass/fail status** in a simple format.  \n",
        "- Generate **overall class analytics** (total, average, highest, lowest).  \n",

        "\n",
        "## Key Features  \n",
        "1. **Student Marks Management**  \n",
        "   - Input marks of multiple students across subjects.  \n",
        "   - View marks of a particular student or subject.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Re-evaluation Module**  \n",
        "   - Update marks if re-checking is done.  \n",
        "   - Maintain the updated record in the system.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Pass/Fail Evaluation**  \n",
        "   - Automatically classify results using NumPy conditions.  \n",
        "   - Represent results as True (Pass) or False (Fail).  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Analytics & Insights**  \n",
        "   - Student-wise total and average.  \n",
        "   - Subject-wise highest and lowest score.  \n",
        "   - Class performance: total marks, class average, topper score, least score.  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. **User-Friendly Menu**  \n",
        "   - Interactive options for teachers/admins.  \n",
        "   - Easy to navigate and update.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "- **Library:** NumPy (for mathematical operations and array handling)  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "## Example Use Case  \n",
        "- A teacher enters marks of **50 students across 5 subjects**.  \n",
        "- With a single click, the teacher can:  \n",
        "  - See **individual student performance**.  \n",
        "  - Identify **which subject has the lowest average**.  \n",
        "  - Know **who is the class topper**.  \n",
